# ClearLineage

ClearLineage is a system theme bringing the absolute finest of transparency effects to your system.

This mod currently supports LineageOS 17 - 19.

To get an impression of the theme,
click yourself through the
[interactive image gallery](https://programminghoch10.github.io/ClearLineage).

### Prerequisites

This mod uses a combo of Magisk-injected system overlays and LSPosed hooks.

You can use the mod without LSPosed,
but it won't work as well and is not recommended.

### Compatibility

* On LineageOS 17 the Theme is still in development
* On LineageOS 18 the Theme is working perfectly
* On LineageOS 19 the whole system looks different, but hey, someone gotta fix Google's bad design choices `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

### Installation

1. Install the module ZIP in Magisk
1. Reboot
1. Enable ClearLineage in LSPosed
1. Reboot
1. Reboot again
1. You should have the full ClearLineage theme active now

### Blur

This module sets the system prop `ro.surface_flinger.supports_background_blur=1`, 
which enables blur effects on your system.

Blur is enabled by default, but it might cause lags.
You can disable blur by going into the device developer settings 
and disabling the option `Allow window-level blurs`.

### Bugs

With Android 12 changing all the time currently, expect there to be inconsistencies.

Do not complain about lags while [Blur](#blur) is enabled.

You can report bugs, but I can't guarantuee I can fix them, especially if I can't replicate them.

You can report bugs in GitHub issues,
or via Telegram

### Contributions

You are welcome to contribute, screenshots of what you changed would be nice, also I won't merge stuff I can't check myself.

### Thank me

I really take **a lot** of time optimizing ClearLineage.

I currently do not take donations,
I rather do this for you to be happy.

And for me to be happy,
I'd like to see you happy.

And tell your friends about it!

Also more screenshots of the theme are appreciated,
