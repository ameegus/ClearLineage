# ClearLineage

ClearLineage is a system theme bringing the absolute finest of transparency effects to your system.

This mod currently supports LineageOS 17 - 19.

To get an impression of the theme,
click yourself through the
[interactive image gallery](https://programminghoch10.github.io/ClearLineage).

### Prerequisites

This mod uses a combo of Magisk-injected system overlays and LSPosed hooks.

You can use the mod without LSPosed,
but it won't work as well and is not recommended.

### Compatibility

* On LineageOS 17 only the XPosed module is supported and thus only slight changes can be observed.
* On LineageOS 18 you have to disable the LineageOS black theme in order for the system to select the ClearLineage colors correctly.
* On LineageOS 19 the whole system looks different, but hey, someone gotta fix Google's bad design choices `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

### Installation

1. Install the module ZIP in Magisk
1. Reboot
1. Enable ClearLineage in LSPosed
1. Reboot
1. Reboot again
1. You should have the full ClearLineage theme active now

### Bugs

With Android 12 changing all the time currently, expect there to be inconsistencies.

You can report bugs, but I can't guarantuee I can fix them, especially if I can't replicate them.

You can report bugs in GitHub issues,
or via Telegram

### Contributions

You are welcome to contribute, screenshots of what you changed would be nice, also I won't merge stuff I can't check myself.

### Thank me

I really take **a lot** of time optimizing ClearLineage.

I currently do not take donations,
I rather do this for you to be happy.

And for me to be happy,
I'd like to see you happy.

And tell your friends about it!

Also more screenshots of the theme are appreciated,
gotta fill up the gallery somehow.
